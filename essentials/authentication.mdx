Orafi uses API keys for authenticating requests to the public API. Include your API key in the `x-api-key` header for all API requests.

### Example

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.orafi.com/transactions/payment/retrieve?payment_id=pay_123 \
  -H "x-api-key: ora_live_1234567890abcdef"
```

### API Key Format

- **Live keys**: `ora_live_` followed by 32 characters
- **Test keys**: `ora_test_` followed by 32 characters

Keep your API keys secure. Never expose them in client-side code or public repositories.
