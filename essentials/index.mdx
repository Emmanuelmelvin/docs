## Who is it for?

Orafi is designed for:

- **Merchants** who want to accept crypto payments without dealing with blockchain complexities
- **Developers** looking for a simple API to integrate payments
- **Businesses** that need reliable, scalable payment processing

## High-level architecture

Orafi sits between your application and the blockchain networks. When a customer initiates a payment:

1. Your application creates a payment request via Orafi's API
2. Orafi generates a unique deposit address and transaction details
3. The customer retrives transaction information Orafi's checkout URL and signs payment transaction with their wallet
4. Checkout URL redirects back to application to verify transaction status
5. Your application receives webhook notifications about payment status
6. Funds are settled according to your configuration

This architecture ensures that you never handle private keys or direct blockchain interactions, while maintaining full control over the payment flow.
