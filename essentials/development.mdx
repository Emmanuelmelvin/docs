# Development Environment

Learn how to set up your development environment for safe testing of Orafi integrations.

## Test vs Live Modes

Orafi provides separate environments for development and production:

- **Test environment**
- **Live environment**
Both uses the same API: `https://api.orafi.com`. To toggle between modes, merchants can visit their dashboard, or use proided endpoint.

Use the test environment for all development and testing to avoid real transactions.

## API Keys

You have separate API keys for each environment:

- **Test API Key**: Used for the test environment(testnet)
- **Live API Key**: Used for production(mainnet)

Keep your live API key secure and never expose it in client-side code.

## Testing Best Practices

### 1. Use Test Mode for Development

Always develop and test your integration using the test environment first.
To switch to live,  you must complete the onboarding process

### 2. Simulate Different Scenarios

Use our test endpoints to simulate various payment scenarios:

- Successful payments
- Failed payments
- Webhook retries
- Refunds

### 3. Webhook Testing

Set up webhook endpoints for testing:

- Use tools like ngrok or localtunnel for local development
- Verify webhook signatures in test mode
- Test webhook retry logic
