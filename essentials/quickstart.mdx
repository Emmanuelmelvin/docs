# Getting Started

Welcome to Orafi! This guide will help you get up and running with your first crypto payment in minutes.

## Account Creation

1. Sign up for an Orafi account at [orafi.com](https://auth.orafi.com)
2. Complete your business profile and onoarding processes
3. Generate your API keys from the dashboard

## API Key Usage

Orafi uses API keys for authentication. You have separate keys for test and live modes.

- **Test mode**: For development and testing(testnet)
- **Live mode**: For production payments(mainnet)

Include your API key in the `x-api-key` header for all requests.

## Test vs Live Environments

- **Endpoint**: `https://api.orafi.com`
Both uses same API

Use test mode for development to avoid real transactions.

## First Payment Example

Let's create your first payment using curl.

### 1. Create a hosted payment

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.orafi.com/transactions/payment/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: your_test_api_key" \
  -d '{
    "amount": 10000,
    "customer": {
      "fullname": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com"
    },
    "txRef": "tx_123456789",
    "type": "HOSTED_CHECKOUT",
    "redirectUrl": "https://yourapp.com/success"
  }'
```

This creates a payment for and returns payment details including a deposit address.

### 2. Check payment status

```bash
curl -X POST https://test.api.orafi.com/transactions/payment/verify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "paymentId": "pay_abc123"
  }'
```
