title: Fee Collection & Charges
description: How platform charges are collected for payments, payouts, and refunds on OraFi.
---

## Overview

OraFi collects platform charges directly at the **smart contract level** using a **basis-points fee model**.  
Fees are deducted automatically during **payments** and **payouts** before funds reach the merchant.

All fee logic is enforced **on-chain**, making it transparent, deterministic, and non-bypassable.

---

## Fee Model

- OraFi uses a **percentage-based fee system**
- Fees are calculated using **basis points** for accuracy
- The current platform fee is **1% per transaction**
- Fees are always deducted **before settlement**

This ensures consistent and predictable charges across all supported flows.

---

## Platform Fee Wallet

- All collected fees are transferred directly to a **platform-controlled admin wallet**
- Fee transfers occur **within the same transaction** as the payment or payout
- This guarantees atomic execution and prevents partial settlement

---

## Payment Charges

### How Payments Work

1. A payment request is created for a specific amount
2. The customer completes the payment with the exact required value
3. OraFi automatically:
   - Validates the payment amount
   - Calculates the platform fee
   - Deducts the fee
   - Sends the remaining balance to the merchant

The merchant never needs to manually calculate or send fees.

---

### Payment Fee Flow

- **1%** is deducted from the total payment amount
- The deducted fee is sent to the **platform wallet**
- The remaining **99%** is sent to the **merchant**
- The payment context is finalized after settlement

---

### Example

| Payment Amount | Platform Fee (1%) | Merchant Receives |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| 1,000 USDC | 10 USDC | 990 USDC |

---

## Payout Charges

Payouts occur when funds are withdrawn from a platform-controlled balance to a merchant’s external wallet.

---

### How Payouts Work

1. A payout request is initiated for a specified amount
2. The platform validates available balance
3. OraFi automatically:
   - Calculates the platform fee
   - Deducts the fee
   - Sends the remaining amount to the destination wallet

---

### Payout Fee Flow

- **1%** is deducted from the payout amount
- The fee is sent to the **platform wallet**
- The remaining balance is transferred to the **merchant**

---

### Example

| Payout Amount | Platform Fee (1%) | Merchant Receives |
|--------------|------------------|------------------|
| 500 USDC | 5 USDC | 495 USDC |

---

## Refund Charges

### Refund Behavior

- **Refunds are not charged**
- The full refunded amount is returned to the customer
- No platform fee is deducted during refunds

This ensures fair customer reimbursement and avoids double-charging.
