# Development Environment

Learn how to set up your development environment for safe testing of Orafi integrations.

## Test vs Live Modes

Orafi provides separate environments for development and production:

- **Test environment**: `https://test.api.orafi.com`
- **Live environment**: `https://api.orafi.com`

Use the test environment for all development and testing to avoid real transactions.

## API Keys

You have separate API keys for each environment:

- **Test API Key**: Used for the test environment
- **Live API Key**: Used for production

Keep your live API key secure and never expose it in client-side code.

## Testing Best Practices

### 1. Use Test Mode for Development

Always develop and test your integration using the test environment first.

### 2. Simulate Different Scenarios

Use our test endpoints to simulate various payment scenarios:

- Successful payments
- Failed payments
- Webhook retries
- Refunds

### 3. Webhook Testing

Set up webhook endpoints for testing:

- Use tools like ngrok or localtunnel for local development
- Verify webhook signatures in test mode
- Test webhook retry logic

### 4. Go Live Checklist

Before switching to live mode:

- [ ] All tests pass in test environment
- [ ] Webhooks are properly configured
- [ ] Business profile is complete
- [ ] Settlement accounts are set up
- [ ] API keys are securely stored
