## Crypto Account Object

The `CryptoAccount` model represents a **saved on-chain wallet address** associated with a business profile.
It is primarily used to enable **payouts without requiring the merchant to re-submit or re-sign wallet details** each time.

Crypto accounts act as **trusted payout destinations** once linked to a profile.

## Relationships (High-Level)
