## Webhook Delivery Object

The `WebhookDelivery` model represents a **single delivery attempt** of a webhook event.
It is used to track **event payloads**, **delivery status**, and **retry behavior** for reliable webhook execution.

Each delivery record provides full visibility into what was sent, when it was sent, and how the receiving server responded.

### Relationships (High-Level)

* **Webhook**
  Each delivery is linked to a single webhook configuration.

* **Transaction**
  Each delivery corresponds to a specific transaction event.

---

### Notes

* Webhook deliveries are **retryable** until a success condition is met or retry limits are exceeded.
* All attempts are recorded to ensure transparency and debuggability.
* Stored payloads enable **event replay** and forensic analysis when needed.
