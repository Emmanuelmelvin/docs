# Getting Started

Welcome to Orafi! This guide will help you get up and running with your first crypto payment in minutes.

## Account Creation

1. Sign up for an Orafi account at [orafi.com](https://orafi.com)
2. Complete your business profile and verification
3. Generate your API keys from the dashboard

## API Key Usage

Orafi uses API keys for authentication. You have separate keys for test and live modes.

- **Test mode**: For development and testing
- **Live mode**: For production payments

Include your API key in the `x-api-key` header for all requests.

## Test vs Live Environments

- **Test environment**: `https://test.api.orafi.com`
- **Live environment**: `https://api.orafi.com`

Use test mode for development to avoid real transactions.

## First Payment Example

Let's create your first payment using curl.

### 1. Create a hosted payment

```bash
curl -X POST https://test.api.orafi.com/transactions/payment/hosted/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: your_test_api_key" \
  -d '{
    "amount": 10000,
    "customer": {
      "fullname": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com"
    },
    "txRef": "tx_123456789",
    "type": "HOSTED_CHECKOUT",
    "redirectUrl": "https://yourapp.com/success"
  }'
```

This creates a payment for $100.00 (assuming amount is in cents) and returns payment details including a deposit address.

### 2. Check payment status

```bash
curl -X POST https://test.api.orafi.com/transactions/payment/verify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "paymentId": "pay_abc123"
  }'
```

### Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Payment verified successfully",
  "data": {
    "id": "pay_abc123",
    "amount": 10000,
    "amountInUSDC": 10.0,
    "token": "USDC",
    "depositAddress": "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e",
    "txRef": "tx_123456789",
    "status": "INITIALIZED",
    "paymentMethod": "HOSTED_CHECKOUT",
    "customerId": "cus_xyz789",
    "transactionId": "txn_def456"
  }
}
